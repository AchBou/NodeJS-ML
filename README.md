# Test application for the deployement of ML model for car price prediction using NodeJS


This project is lab for deploying a machine learning model for car prediction using NodeJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
NodeJS
```
Just download and install it in order for npm to work.

### Installation

**1-First Step**

`npm install `

**2-Second step**

Then Run server with :

`npm start` or `node app.js`



## Built with

this app is fully built using HTML, CSS and Javascipt runing both in Frontend to read and send the data, and Backend in the NodeJS environment.

**Librairies used**

* `express`: a framework of nodeJS that make the code simpler.
* `csv-parser`: a library to parse csv files.
* `fs`: a library to read system files.
* `body-parser`: enable us to parse the body data in requests.
* `multer`: parses the data that comes in a "multipart/form-data" content-type.
